Scripts to run all the experiments in the paper. 
Each experiment is in a separate folder. Some experiments are run in two stages, a script 
usually called `evaluate.py` (or `estimate.py`) first populate a folder `results/` with 
the results of the experiments and a script `plot.py` read the results and generate 
the plots, saving them on `plots/` folder. See each individual experiment  folders for details. 

Execute `run.sh` in the current directory to generate all the plots.
