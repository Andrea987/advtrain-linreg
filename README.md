## Description

Given pair of input-output samples $(x_i, y_i), i = 1, \dots, n$, adversarial training in linear regression is 
formulated as  a min-max optimization problem:

$$\min_\beta \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \max_{||\Delta x_i|| \le \delta} (y_i - \beta^\top(x_i+ \Delta x_i))^2$$

The paper analyse the properties of this problem and this repository contain code for reproducing the experiements
in the paper.


## Folder content
- The file `advtrain.py` to a solution of adverasarial training problem using CvxPy (and is used by the other scripts).
- The scripts`fig1and3_regularization_path.py`: generate Figures 1 and 3 from the paper.
- The folder `other_experiments` contain scripts for generating the figures in the papers appendix.
